Subject:	Re: Licensing for Handsontable

Hi Matt, 
 
Yes, we have two similar products: Handsontable (under MIT license) and Handsontable PRO 
(the one you saw at https://handsontable.com/pricing.html ). PRO version has many more 
features but the core is the same for both products. 
 
MIT version is available here https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable and it's totally for 
free.. 
 
We are planning to add PRO version on Github so the repo may change but the current 0.25.0 
version will always stay free to use. 
 
ps. I'm really glad you're considering Handsontable to be a part of your University's IT 
infrastructure and I'd be happy to see the end results of its implementation. 
 
  
Best Regards,

Hi,
 
Am I correct in understanding that the code in the Github repo 
(https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable) is totally free and MIT licensed? I ask because 
there is a website (https://handsontable.com/pricing.html) where you seem to be selling the same, 
or similar, software.
 
My university has policies about getting all licenses approved before purchasing or using 
software, so I want to make sure the version on Github will always be free to use.
 
Thanks,
Matt
